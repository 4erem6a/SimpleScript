# Code blocks & block statement:

## Code blocks:

Code blocks are used to unite few statement into one.

Is SS, code blocks are defined by `{}` curly braces.

Syntax:  `{ <statement>... }`

Example:

```
    {
        let x = 1
        let y = 2
    }
    //Now we have 2 let statements united into 1 block statement
```

## Block statement:

You can't define code blocks just in any place in the code,

but if you need it, you can use `block` statement to define plain-executable code blocks.

Syntax: `block <block>`

Example:

```
//...
block {
    //Code written here will executed as a block statement
}
//...
```
